# Welcome
Thermal-plex is a fluorescent imaging method that significantly expands the multiplexity by using programmable step-wised DNA melting to visualize biology. The method will transform the way to illuminate biology spatially with unprecedented speed and information to understand biology with precision at the single-cell level and scalable at the tissue scale.
