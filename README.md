# Welcome
Thermal-plex is a fluorescent imaging method that significantly expand the multiplexity by using programmable step-wised DNA melting to visulize biology. The method will transform the way to illuminate biology with unprecedented speed and information to understand biology with precision at single cell level and scalable at thick tissue scale.
